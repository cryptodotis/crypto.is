	<h1>Interact</h1>
	<p>There are many ways to interact and get involved with the various anonymity projects out there. To get involved with The Crypto Project:</p>
	
	<h3>Donate Your Time</h3>
	<p>Are you a developer? Can you write documentation? The Crypto Project is looking for anyone that can contribute to a project in anyway.  Check out <a href="/interact/time/">Contributing Time</a> for more information.</p>
	
	<h3>Fund Anonymity Servers</h3>
	<p>To donate funds to The Crypto Project, learn what we use the money for, and to find information about donating to other worthy projects, check out <a href="/interact/money/">Contributing Money</a></p>

	
	<h3>Contribute Servers, Shares and Bandwidth</h3>
	<p>One of the best ways to help out anonymity projects is to setup and run a server yourself.  But if the thought of that intimidates you, we'll help you out, either hands on or off.  Check out <a href="/interact/goods/">Contributing Goods</a> to find out how you can put spare servers or bandwidth to good use.</p>
