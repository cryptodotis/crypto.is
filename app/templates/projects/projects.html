		<h1>Projects</h1>
		<p>Crypto.is has begun work on a few things it calls projects:</p>
		
		<h3>Code Audit Feed</h3>
		<p>Writing secure code is hard.  But if everyone is intimidated by the prospect, no secure code would be written.  The Code Audit Feed seeks to be a single feed of commits to crypto and anonyminity tools.  It is the hope that an easy to skim feed of changes will encourage people to watch projects for changes relating to their area of expertise so they can audit and prehaps become involved in the project.</p>

		<h3>Intro to Crypto</h3>
		<p>These series of articles aim to show the layperson what benefits using cryptography and anonyminity software can provide them, how to install and use the software, and finally how to give back to the community by running services of their own.</p>
		
		<h3>Code Clearing House</h3>
		<p>It can be a wide internet out there.  This project aims to group security and anonyminity software, provide an overview of what it does and doesn't provide, and links to further resources.</p>

		<!--

		<h3>Bleeding Edge</h3>
		<p>This area is meant to be a testbed of bleeding edge technologies like Strict Transport Security.  While not a comprehensive walkthrough - we hope to provide enough information for experienced sysadmins to set up bleeding edge features, as well as link to existing implementations.</p>
